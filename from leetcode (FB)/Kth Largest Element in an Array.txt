Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

For example,
Given [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2, return 5.

Note: 
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ array's length.

        heap = []
        for num in nums:
            heapq.heappush(heap, -1*num)
        for i in range(k-1):
            heapq.heappop(heap)
        return -1*heapq.heappop(heap)
