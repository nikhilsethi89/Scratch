Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

For example, you may serialize the following tree

    1
   / \
  2   3
     / \
    4   5
as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]", just the same as how LeetCode OJ serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.
Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.

class Codec:

    def serialize(self, root):
        """Encodes a tree to a single string.
        
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: str
        """
        if root==None:
            return ""
        q=[]
        q.append(root)
        s=""
        
        while q:
            node=q.pop(0)
            if node==None:
                s=s+'# '
            else:
                s=s+str(node.val)+' '
                q.append(node.left)
                q.append(node.right)
        
        return s.strip()
        

    def deserialize(self, data):
        """Decodes your encoded data to tree.

        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        if data=="":
            return None
