ETL flow

1. Extract data from hive/ files

2. Transform and load into fact tables (add PK, FK, Unique constraints)
	- Make this as much granular as possible so that we can later aggregate on top of it to get different 
	data cuts

	- Structure of table - Date, Dimension 1, Dimiension 2.., Metric 1, Metric 2....

3. Create reporting tables on top of them to support the dashboards
