	Source - organic search, paid ads, in-app referrals, 


2. Retention
	Returning users/ Total users
	user lifetime


3. Engagement
	MAU, DAU
	Mobile vs Total DAU/MAU (ratio metric)
	Session Length
	Session Interval

4. Monetization
	ARPU (Avg Revenue per User) - Avg Rev by Day/ DAU for the period

KPI's

	1. DAU  = No. of distinct active users (based off session) in a day
	2. MAU = No. of distince active users in a month
	3. Stickiness = DAU/MAU
	4. Retention = No of users retaining after a particular perdiod/No. of users who originally signed 		up or 	logged into the app for the first time
	5. Churn = 1 - Retention
	6. ARPU (Avg Revenue Per User) = Total Revenue for a period/ Total active users for that period (avg 		of MAU at beg & end of quarter)
	7. Lifetime = 1/Churn rate (depends on the period used for calculating the retention). If looking at 		monthly (d30) retention then lifetime will be in months
	8. Customer Lifetime value = ARPU (for that period) * Lifetime. 
	9. Avg session duration
	10. No. of sessions per DAU
	11. Cost per Acquistion = Total cost of campaign/number of acquisitions
